# Easybank Landing Page

This project was created as a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN). The aim was to create it to look as close to the design as possible.

## Motivation

I decided to take this challenge, as there was an in-depth tutorial in how to achieve the design. This tutorial also included the use of SCSS, which I had not used before, so I saw it as an opportunity to learn more about how to use it. Alongside this, it also gave me the chance to enhance my knowledge on frontend technologies.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript (Minimal Use)

## Demo

A live demo of this can be found [here](https://frontend-mentor-landing.netlify.app/).
